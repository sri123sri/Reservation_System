# Reservation_System

The online reservation system we will build will be a simple console-based application that allows users to make, view, and cancel reservations.
Reservations can simply be made by giving information of user.
It will return output as reservation ID. 
Cancelling of reservation is take place by ID. 
It will delete reservation of given ID. 
Summing up all the things, OOPS and some basic java concepts are the core of this system.
